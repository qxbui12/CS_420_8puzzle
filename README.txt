When starting the program, the user will be greeted with 2 choices: 
	(0) Write input
	(1) Take input from a text file
Typing in either 0 or 1 on the keyboard will cause the option to be selected
Next, the user is asked to chooose enter either 1 or 2 for the next question.
If the user chooses 1, the heuristic function will be Hamming (H1), and if the user
chooses 2, the heuristic function will be Manhattan (H2).
If the user chooses option 0 to write input, then the user will have to type in a series of 9 numbers
from 0 to 8 with no repeats and separated by spaces. The user can also press enter between lines, 
so the format can either be "x x x x x x x x x" or "x x x 
						    x x x 
					            x x x"
If the user chooses option 1 to take input from a text file, then the default text file
with the name "infile.txt" will be loaded. The format of the file is "x x x x x x x x x", 
where x represented a unique 0-9 number, and each number are separated by a space key.

When the program finished executing, the user will have the choice to enter 1 to repeat 
the program one more time, or press any other numbers to end the program.
